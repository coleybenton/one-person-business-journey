  <p>Preface: Expect to take 6+ months to see tangible results & improvement. You have to make people interested in the topics you speak of (of your interest). Even if uncommon, how did you gradually become interested and how can you pass that importance on. Think long term - instead of one and done, a 10 year long game of educating people and introducing people to your interests.</p>
  <h1>Evergreen/Timeless Skills (Medium & Message)</h1>

    <h3>Writing</h3>
      <p>The Medium for Distribution - a way of putting your valuable message in front of people (or else nobody sees your value) </p>
