  <h1>The Internet (Digital Leverage)</h1>
    <h3>Social Media</h3>
      <p>(discord, patreon, starting with twitter (easiest), linked in or instagram))</p>
    <h3>No Code Tools (website builders, core dashboards, membership dashboards, social media)</h3>
      <p></p>
    <h3>Networking</h3>
      <p>Creating connections is an increasingly important skill, and by utilizing tools such as social media we can build this skill effectively. A seven step process to networking:
      <ul>
        <li>locate a person to DM: (applies to paid work as well) reach out to people that you are inspired by, want to work with, want to strategize with and that you see potential for mutual benefit. Note that if you have less or no followers than someone and you have no content you may be viewed as not having anything of value to them relating to social media</li>
        <li>send them an inspired comment about their content: find a piece of their content or their work that they resonated with or that truly inspired you. slight usage of law of reciprocity (giving positivity increases chance of receiving). Ex.) "What's up Dan, this tweet hit me hard. I've been going through it the past couple of days and this instantly gave me some relief. Thank you. (add link to post you liked)." </li>
        <li>show interest in them: in receiving no response, you can reach out again (after some time) in the same manner, and keep doing that till they respond. Ask them about their goals, what they are building, what they do for work and this gives you the opportunity to give value at some point (even if you don't have value to give right now) ex.) "What are your next plans with Modern Mastery? It's been crazy seeing it grow, I'm curious what you've got in store." and "Do you have anything that you're building right now? With that kind of content you must have something bigger in the works."</li>
        <li>lead with value: even though it's easy to assume you have nothing of value to offer - consider sending a resource that can help them with their goals (or offering assistance if you have experience and skills to help), connect them with someone else in your network, or continuing to have a good conversation and show interest,
           </li>
        <li>schedule a call with them to make a deeper connection: (optional but highly recommended, Zoom or other face to face calls are recommended) you realize that behind the follower counts and status they are human just like you, can help the person out with what they are building or can just talk shop</li>
        <li>follow up with value: could be space between the messages youve already, conversation fizzled out, keep their goal in mind when communicating with them and if you stumble across any content that will help them get to their goals, or you are building something that could help them, let them know - ex.) "I remember you telling me about your plans for (their project or goal). I found this today and thought youd find it helpful."</li>
        <li>follow up with an ask: think of the long game, building a good network with them. ask them to join a mastermind group, send them one of your posts that you put alot of time into and ask any specific questions you have for them without paying for consulting </li>
        <li>(bonus) understand that none of these steps are immediate</li>
      </ul></p>
    <h3>Distribution</h3>
      <p>Built on social media, gather an audience retain the audience and take them from one platform to another ex.) youtube -> email newsletter or your own website where you don't answer to an algorithm. You can also borrow distribution, by getting on other peoples podcasts for example. To get an idea of high performing ideas, go to channels on youtube you aspire towards and filter by most popular videos, on medium you can just skim the home page, and with the tools Twemex and TweetHunter you can filter any accounts tweets and see what their highest performing content is
